# Understanding and enabling the GitHub Copilot coding agent

## What is the GitHub Copilot Coding Agent?

**Coding Agent** = Autonomous development assistant that runs **inside GitHub itself** (not just your IDE). Acts like a background teammate.

### How It Works

**You give it a scoped task** ‚Üí Agent handles everything:

1. Creates a branch
2. Writes commits
3. Opens draft pull request
4. Updates PR description with status
5. Requests your review

**Task examples**: Bug fix, incremental feature, documentation update

## Availability & Plans

| Category         | Details                                                                                                   |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Plans**        | Pro, Pro+, Business, Enterprise                                                                           |
| **Repositories** | All GitHub-hosted repos (except managed user accounts or where explicitly disabled)                       |
| **Access**       | GitHub.com, GitHub Mobile, API/CLI, Agents panel, Copilot Chat, IDE, MCP-supported tools, Raycast (macOS) |

## What the Coding Agent Can Do

| Task               | Description                                   |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Fix bugs**       | Debug and resolve bugs/regressions            |
| **New features**   | Implement incremental features                |
| **Test coverage**  | Improve coverage or generate missing tests    |
| **Documentation**  | Update or create documentation                |
| **Technical debt** | Address debt and "nice-to-have" backlog items |

## Delegating Work to the Agent (2 Ways)

### Method 1: Assign an Issue to Copilot

**Where**: GitHub.com, GitHub Mobile, API, CLI

**How**: Assign issue ‚Üí Agent works ‚Üí Opens PR ‚Üí Requests review

### Method 2: Ask Copilot to Create a PR

**Where**:

- Agents panel on GitHub
- Copilot Chat
- Your IDE
- Other agentic tools with MCP support
- Raycast on macOS

**Iteration**: Mention `@copilot` in PR comment to ask it to iterate on work

## Coding Agent vs Traditional IDE Assistants

| Aspect            | Traditional IDE Assistant                    | Coding Agent                          |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Location**      | Works locally in IDE                         | Runs on GitHub                        |
| **Manual work**   | You create branches, push commits, write PRs | Agent automates all of this           |
| **Visibility**    | Private session, team can't see              | All work visible as commits on GitHub |
| **Traceability**  | Limited                                      | Full session logs & PR history        |
| **Steering**      | Synchronous local sessions                   | Via PR review comments                |
| **Collaboration** | Individual work                              | Teammates can see steps & jump in     |

**Key Difference**: Traditional = local help ‚Üí Coding Agent = transparent, collaborative teammate on GitHub

## Coding Agent vs "Agent Mode" in IDEs

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important distinction** - These are different things:

| Feature           | Coding Agent                             | Agent Mode (Copilot Edits)      |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Where it runs** | GitHub Actions-powered environment       | Your IDE session                |
| **What it does**  | Completes tasks assigned via issues/chat | Performs autonomous local edits |
| **Output**        | Creates pull requests                    | Direct edits in your IDE        |
| **Assignment**    | Via GitHub issues or Copilot Chat        | Within IDE session              |
| **Covered in**    | This module                              | Visual Studio/VS Code feature   |

## Enabling the Coding Agent

### Organization-Owned Repositories

Managed by **organization or enterprise administrators**

### Personal Repositories

Configure in **account settings**

### Before You Start

‚úÖ Ensure agent is enabled before assigning tasks

## Usage Costs: GitHub Actions + PRUs

The coding agent uses **two main resources**:

| Resource                         | What It's For                                      | Cost Model                                      |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **GitHub Actions minutes**       | Ephemeral build/test environment where agent works | Uses your monthly Actions allowance             |
| **Premium Request Units (PRUs)** | Power advanced model reasoning                     | 1 PRU per model request (starting June 4, 2025) |

### PRU & Actions Cost Details

üìÖ **Starting June 4, 2025**: Agent uses **1 PRU per model request**

‚úÖ **Within monthly allowance**: No extra charges for Actions minutes or PRUs

‚ö†Ô∏è **Beyond allowance**: Additional charges apply

### PRU Usage Best Practices

üí° **Use PRUs where they add value**:

- Multi-file edits
- Test generation
- Broader diffs needing deeper reasoning

‚ö° **Save PRUs on**:

- Lightweight edits
- Simple, single-file changes

## Cost Management Summary

| Aspect                 | Strategy                                      |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Budget tracking**    | Monitor Actions minutes & PRU consumption     |
| **Optimize usage**     | Use for complex tasks, avoid for simple edits |
| **Stay within limits** | Use monthly allowances effectively            |
| **Plan ahead**         | Understand costs before assigning work        |

## Key Differences Summary

| vs Traditional IDE Assistant   | vs Agent Mode (IDE)                     |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| ‚úÖ Works on GitHub (not local) | ‚úÖ Different location (GitHub vs IDE)   |
| ‚úÖ Automates branch/commit/PR  | ‚úÖ Different output (PR vs local edits) |
| ‚úÖ Team-visible & traceable    | ‚úÖ Different assignment method          |
| ‚úÖ Collaborative workflow      | ‚úÖ Different use case                   |

## Next Steps

With agent enabled and costs understood:

1. ‚úÖ Review security posture
2. ‚úÖ Understand risks
3. ‚úÖ Account for limitations
4. ‚úÖ Plan real work assignments

# Security, risks, and limitations of the Copilot coding agent

## Security Model & Built-In Protections

üîí **Security is foundational** - Agent respects existing controls + adds its own guardrails

| Protection                     | What It Means                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Subject to governance**      | Org/enterprise settings govern availability; all your security policies apply                   |
| **Restricted environment**     | Runs in sandbox on GitHub Actions with firewalled internet + read-only repo access              |
| **Branch limits**              | Can only create/push to `copilot/` branches; all branch protections still apply                 |
| **Permission-aware**           | Only responds to users with write permission; ignores comments from others                      |
| **Outside-collaborator rules** | Draft PRs require approval by write-permission user before Actions run; requestor can't approve |
| **Compliance & attribution**   | All commits coauthored with developer who assigned task; clear attribution                      |

**Key Principle**: Agent operates **inside your existing guardrails** + adds extra protections

## Risks & Mitigations

Although built with security in mind, there are risks to plan for. GitHub applies mitigations:

### Risk 1: Agent Pushes Code

**The Risk**: Autonomous code pushes could be dangerous

**Mitigations Applied**:

| Mitigation                  | How It Works                                                                                      |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Write access only**       | Only users with write access can trigger agent work                                               |
| **Branch restrictions**     | Pushes restricted to `copilot/` branches only (not main/master)                                   |
| **Limited credentials**     | Agent's credentials allow simple push only (no direct `git push`)                                 |
| **Workflow approval**       | GitHub Actions workflows won't run until write-permission user clicks "Approve and run workflows" |
| **Requestor can't approve** | Person who requested PR can't approve it, maintaining required approvals                          |

### Risk 2: Access to Sensitive Information

**The Risk**: Agent might access sensitive data

**Mitigation Applied**:

| Mitigation                       | Details                                                   |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Firewall-restricted internet** | Agent's internet access is firewall-restricted by default |
| **Customizable**                 | You can customize or disable the firewall per policy      |

### Risk 3: Prompt Injection

**The Risk**: Malicious hidden instructions in comments/issues

**Mitigation Applied**:

| Mitigation                     | How It Works                                                               |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hidden character filtering** | HTML comments and hidden characters filtered before passing input to agent |
| **Reduces injection risk**     | Minimizes chance of hidden harmful instructions                            |

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Still review outputs carefully, just as you would code written by any team member

## Known Limitations

Understanding limitations helps you plan usage effectively.

### Workflow Limitations

| Limitation                    | Impact                                                      | Workaround                                             |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Same repository only**      | Can only make changes in the same repo as assigned issue/PR | Split work across repos if needed                      |
| **Repository-scoped context** | Context limited to assigned repo by default                 | Broaden via MCP if needed                              |
| **One PR per task**           | Opens exactly one pull request per task                     | Break large work into multiple tasks                   |
| **Can't modify existing PRs** | Can't modify PRs it didn't create                           | Add as reviewer for feedback (use Copilot code review) |

### Compatibility Limitations

| Limitation                          | Impact                                                          | What You Need to Know                                                    |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **No commit signing**               | Doesn't sign commits                                            | Must rewrite commit history before merging if you require signed commits |
| **GitHub-hosted runners only**      | Requires GitHub-hosted Ubuntu x64 runners                       | Self-hosted runners not supported                                        |
| **Not for managed user accounts**   | Not available for personal repos owned by managed user accounts | Runners unavailable for these accounts                                   |
| **Ignores content exclusions**      | Agent can see and update excluded files                         | Be aware of this when excluding sensitive files                          |
| **Public code policy not enforced** | "Suggestions matching public code" policy isn't enforced        | References may not be provided                                           |
| **GitHub-hosted repos only**        | Works only with GitHub-hosted repositories                      | Can't use with external repo hosting                                     |
| **No model selection**              | Can't change AI model used by agent                             | Model selected by GitHub                                                 |

## Security & Limitation Summary

### ‚úÖ Security Strengths

- Operates within your existing guardrails
- Sandboxed environment with restricted access
- Permission-aware (write access required)
- Clear attribution via coauthored commits
- Filtered input to prevent prompt injection
- Branch protections still apply

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Key Risks to Manage

- Review code outputs carefully (as with any team member)
- Understand branch restrictions (`copilot/` only)
- Plan for workflow approval requirements
- Be aware of content exclusion limitations

### üìã Planning Checklist

Before using the coding agent:

- [ ] Understand security model and protections
- [ ] Review risk mitigations
- [ ] Check compatibility with your setup (signed commits? self-hosted runners?)
- [ ] Plan for workflow limitations (one repo, one PR per task)
- [ ] Set expectations for content exclusions behavior
- [ ] Ensure proper permissions configured

## Best Practices

| Practice                   | Why                                                   |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Review all agent PRs**   | Treat as code from any team member                    |
| **Use branch protections** | Leverage existing protections for `copilot/` branches |
| **Monitor permissions**    | Ensure only appropriate users have write access       |
| **Plan task scope**        | Work within one-repo, one-PR-per-task constraints     |
| **Document requirements**  | If you need signed commits, plan rewrite process      |

# Assigning, tracking, and troubleshooting Copilot coding agent tasks

## How Assignment Works

When you assign an issue to Copilot:

| Step | What Happens             | Visual Signal                                   |
| ---- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Agent acknowledges       | üëÄ reaction added to issue                      |
| 2    | Creates dedicated branch | `copilot/` branch created                       |
| 3    | Opens draft PR           | Draft PR linked to issue                        |
| 4    | Begins agent session     | GitHub Actions-powered environment              |
| 5    | Works on task            | Pushes commits + updates PR body with status    |
| 6    | Completes                | Posts "Copilot finished work" + requests review |

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Copilot receives issue title, description, and existing comments **at time of assignment**. Later comments on the issue are **not seen** - add new info as comments on the agent's PR.

## Assigning Issues to Copilot (4 Methods)

### Method 1: GitHub.com

**Steps**:

1. Navigate to repository's **Issues** tab
2. Open issue you want to delegate
3. Right sidebar ‚Üí **Assignees** ‚Üí Select **Copilot**

**Also works from**:

- List of issues on repository's Issues page
- GitHub Projects

### Method 2: GitHub Mobile

Assign Copilot directly from mobile app (same as assigning any user)

### Method 3: GitHub CLI

```bash
gh issue edit [issue-number] --add-assignee copilot
```

### Method 4: GraphQL API

Programmatic assignment for automated workflows:

**Step 1: Check availability**

```graphql
query {
  repository(owner: "octo-org", name: "octo-repo") {
    suggestedActors(capabilities: [CAN_BE_ASSIGNED], first: 100) {
      nodes {
        login
        __typename
        ... on Bot {
          id
        }
        ... on User {
          id
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Step 2: Get repository ID**

```graphql
query {
  repository(owner: "octo-org", name: "octo-repo") {
    id
  }
}
```

**Step 3a: Create and assign new issue**

```graphql
mutation {
  createIssue(
    input: {
      repositoryId: "REPOSITORY_ID"
      title: "Implement comprehensive unit tests"
      body: "DETAILS"
      assigneeIds: ["BOT_ID"]
    }
  ) {
    issue {
      id
      title
      assignees(first: 10) {
        nodes {
          login
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Step 3b: Assign existing issue**

```graphql
# Get issue ID first
query {
  repository(owner: "monalisa", name: "octocat") {
    issue(number: 9000) {
      id
      title
    }
  }
}

# Then assign
mutation {
  replaceActorsForAssignable(
    input: { assignableId: "ISSUE_ID", actorIds: ["BOT_ID"] }
  ) {
    assignable {
      ... on Issue {
        id
        title
        assignees(first: 10) {
          nodes {
            login
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Use case**: Integrating Copilot into automated workflows

## Tracking Copilot's Progress (5 Stages)

| Stage                 | Event              | What You See                                    | Timing                       |
| --------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **1. Confirmation**   | Issue acknowledged | üëÄ reaction on issue                            | Immediately after assignment |
| **2. PR Creation**    | Draft PR opened    | Draft PR linked to issue, timeline event        | Within seconds               |
| **3. Active Session** | Work begins        | "Copilot started work" in PR timeline           | Shortly after PR creation    |
| **4. Live Updates**   | Ongoing work       | Status messages in PR body, commits pushed      | During session               |
| **5. Completion**     | Work finished      | "Copilot finished work" event, review requested | When task complete           |

### Live Session Logs

**Where**: Agents page (all sessions - past and present visible)

**How to access**: Click **View session** on PR to open live log viewer

**Features**:

- Watch Copilot's actions in real time
- See what it's doing at each step
- Stop session if needed (click **Stop session**)

## Iterating with Copilot

**How to request changes**: Mention `@copilot` in a PR comment

**Workflow**:

1. You leave comment with `@copilot` mention
2. Copilot posts üëÄ reaction (confirms receipt)
3. "Copilot started work" appears in PR timeline
4. Copilot resumes work with your feedback

‚ö†Ô∏è **Permission required**: Only comments from users with **write permission** are processed

**Benefit**: Iterate without leaving normal review workflow

## Approvals & Workflows

| Aspect                | Rule                                             | Why                                                            |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **PR state**          | Always draft                                     | Requires human approval before merge                           |
| **GitHub Actions**    | Don't run automatically                          | Security protection                                            |
| **Running workflows** | Click "Approve and run workflows" in merge box   | Manual approval required                                       |
| **PR approval**       | Developer who requested PR **cannot approve it** | Preserves "required reviews" rules, ensures independent review |

**Key takeaway**: Human oversight built into every step

## Troubleshooting Playbook

| Problem                                | Likely Cause                               | Solution                                                                                                                                     |

## Best Practices

| Practice                         | Why                                                  |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Clear issue descriptions**     | Copilot only sees info at assignment time            |
| **Use PR comments for updates**  | Later issue comments aren't seen by agent            |
| **Monitor session logs**         | Track progress in real time                          |
| **Provide repo guidance**        | Use `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for CI/testing |
| **Review before merging**        | Always treat as code from any contributor            |
| **Use write permissions wisely** | Only authorized users should interact                |

## Key Takeaways

‚úÖ **Multiple assignment methods**: GitHub.com, Mobile, CLI, API
‚úÖ **Visible progress tracking**: 5 stages with clear signals (üëÄ, draft PR, timeline events)
‚úÖ **Iterate like with humans**: Use PR comments with `@copilot` mentions

# Customizing, extending and validating the copilot coding agent

## Overview

The coding agent runs in a secure, ephemeral GitHub Actions environment. You can customize it to:

- **Preseed environment** - Preinstall tools, dependencies, secrets
- **Extend capabilities** - Add external tools via Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- **Validate output** - Apply best practices for testing before merge

## Preseeding the Development Environment

### Setup Workflow: `copilot-setup-steps.yml`

**Location**: `.github/workflows/copilot-setup-steps.yml` (on default branch)

**Purpose**: Preinstall dependencies and tools to improve reliability and speed

#### Configuration Requirements

| Requirement           | Details                                                                    |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Job name**          | Must be named `copilot-setup-steps`                                        |
| **Allowed keys**      | `steps`, `permissions`, `runs-on`, `container`, `services`, `snapshot`     |
| **Timeout**           | `timeout-minutes` ‚â§ 59                                                     |
| **Checkout depth**    | `actions/checkout` fetch-depth overridden for safe rollback                |
| **Execution**         | Runs standalone for validation, then automatically before agent starts     |
| **Supported runners** | Ubuntu x64 only (self-hosted runners NOT supported)                        |
| **Larger runners**    | Set `runs-on` to label/group (e.g., `ubuntu-4-core`) - must add them first |

#### Example: TypeScript Project

```yaml
name: "Copilot Setup Steps"

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  push:
    paths:
      - .github/workflows/copilot-setup-steps.yml
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - .github/workflows/copilot-setup-steps.yml

jobs:
  copilot-setup-steps:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v5
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: "20"
          cache: "npm"
      - name: Install JavaScript dependencies
        run: npm ci
```

#### Git LFS Support

If using Git Large File Storage:

```yaml
jobs:
  copilot-setup-steps:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v5
        with:
          lfs: true
```

#### Firewall Customization

| Default                            | Customization Option                    |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Internet access limited by default | Can customize or disable per org policy |
| Reduces exfiltration risk          | Adjust based on security requirements   |

## Extending with Model Context Protocol (MCP)

### What is MCP?

**MCP** = Open standard for connecting LLMs to **tools** and **data**

**Agent capability**: Use tools from local or remote MCP servers to expand functionality

‚ö†Ô∏è **Limitations**:

- Only **MCP tools** supported (not resources or prompts)
- Remote MCP servers requiring OAuth NOT supported

### Default MCP Servers

| Server                    | Capabilities                         | Token Scope                                       |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **GitHub MCP Server**     | Access issues, PRs, GitHub data      | Read-only, scoped to current repo (customizable)  |
| **Playwright MCP Server** | Read, interact, screenshot web pages | Pages accessible in agent environment (localhost) |

### Repository Configuration

**How to configure**: Admins declare MCP servers via JSON configuration in repo

**Behavior**: Once configured, agent **autonomously uses tools** (no per-use approval prompts)

üìö **See**: [Extending GitHub Copilot coding agent with MCP](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/github-copilot-code-agent/4-customize-extend-validate-copilot-code-agent)

### MCP Best Practices

| Practice                           | Why                                           |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Review third-party MCP servers** | Performance and output quality implications   |
| **Prefer read tools**              | Minimize risk; allow write only when needed   |
| **Validate MCP config carefully**  | Ensure security and correctness before saving |

## Testing & Validating Agent Output

### Accountability & Responsibility

‚ö†Ô∏è **You remain accountable** for quality and security of agent-generated code

### Validation Workflow Checklist

| Step                            | How to Implement                                                                        | Purpose                                     |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Run CI on every PR**       | Tests, linters, scanning                                                                | Automated quality checks                    |
| **2. Manual approval required** | Click "Approve and run workflows"                                                       | Human gate before automation runs           |
| **3. Manual inspection**        | Review high-impact or sensitive areas                                                   | Catch issues automation might miss          |
| **4. Agent-generated tests**    | Ask agent: "Add Jest unit tests for all functions in `src/utils/` following repo style" | Multi-file test generation (uses PRUs)      |
| **5. Enforce rulesets**         | Configure branch protection rules                                                       | PRs must pass tests + scanning before merge |
| **6. Label agent PRs**          | Use labels like `agent-refactor`, `agent-tests`                                         | Monitor, triage, and revert if needed       |
| **7. Iterate instructions**     | Update `.github/copilot-instructions.md`                                                | Fix repeated mistakes                       |
| **8. Quick reversion**          | Revert and request new changes                                                          | Fast recovery from bad outputs              |

### CI/CD Integration

**Workflow**:

```
Agent creates PR ‚Üí Draft state ‚Üí You click "Approve and run workflows" ‚Üí
CI runs (tests, linters, scanning) ‚Üí Review results ‚Üí Manual inspection ‚Üí
Approve or request changes ‚Üí Merge
```

### Using PRUs Intentionally for Validation

**When to use PRUs for validation**:

| Task                        | PRU Value | When to Apply           |
| --------------------------- | --------- | ----------------------- |
| **Test coverage expansion** | High      | Critical code paths     |
| **Directory audits**        | High      | Major refactors         |
| **Risky area scans**        | High      | Security-sensitive code |
| **Lightweight checks**      | Low       | Routine changes         |

**Strategy**: Apply PRUs intentionally to maximize value

### Quality Assurance Best Practices

**Ask agent to generate tests**:

```
Example: "Add Jest unit tests for all functions in src/utils/ following repo style"
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: Multi-file test generation consumes PRUs

**Enforce quality gates**:

- Tests must pass
- Linters must pass
- Security scanning must pass
- Manual review required

### Labeling Strategy

| Label            | Purpose                    | Benefit                  |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `agent-refactor` | Tracks refactoring work    | Easy to monitor/revert   |
| `agent-tests`    | Tracks test generation     | Audit test quality       |
| `agent-docs`     | Tracks documentation       | Review doc accuracy      |
| `agent-feature`  | Tracks feature development | Measure agent capability |

### Iterative Improvement

**When you see repeated mistakes**:

1. Update `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
2. Provide clearer guidance for CI/testing
3. Add examples of expected behavior
4. Specify project conventions

**Fast recovery**:

- Revert quickly if output is problematic
- Request new changes from agent with updated instructions
- Learn from mistakes to improve instructions

## Configuration Files Summary

| File                                        | Purpose                               | Required |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `.github/workflows/copilot-setup-steps.yml` | Preseed environment with dependencies | Optional |
| `.github/copilot-instructions.md`           | Provide repo-level guidance to agent  | Optional |
| MCP configuration JSON                      | Extend agent with external tools      | Optional |

## Security Considerations

| Aspect                    | Consideration                           | Best Practice                           |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Preseeded environment** | Dependencies could have vulnerabilities | Use pinned versions, audit dependencies |
| **MCP extensions**        | Third-party tools add risk              | Review thoroughly, prefer read-only     |
| **Agent PRs**             | Generated code may have issues          | Always run CI, manual inspection        |
| **Firewall**              | Default restricted internet access      | Customize carefully per policy          |

## PRU Optimization for Validation

**High-value PRU usage**:

‚úÖ Comprehensive test generation for critical features
‚úÖ Security audits across multiple files
‚úÖ Performance analysis of complex algorithms
‚úÖ Cross-system impact analysis

**Low-value PRU usage**:

‚ùå Lightweight syntax checks
‚ùå Simple single-file edits
‚ùå Routine documentation updates

**Strategy**: Reserve PRUs for complex validation tasks that benefit from deeper reasoning

## Workflow Integration Example

**Complete validation workflow**:

```
1. Agent assigned issue
2. Agent creates PR (draft)
3. Setup workflow runs (copilot-setup-steps.yml)
4. Agent generates code
5. Agent generates tests
6. You click "Approve and run workflows"
7. CI runs (tests, linters, scanning)
8. You review code manually
9. Check labels (agent-refactor, etc.)
10. Iterate with @copilot if needed
11. Approve and merge
```

## Key Takeaways

‚úÖ **Preseed environment**: Use `copilot-setup-steps.yml` to install dependencies (improves speed/reliability)
‚úÖ **Extend capabilities**: MCP adds external tools (GitHub data, web interaction)
‚úÖ **Validate rigorously**: CI + manual inspection + tests + linting before merge
‚úÖ **Label & track**: Use labels to monitor, triage, and revert agent PRs
‚úÖ **Iterate instructions**: Update `.github/copilot-instructions.md` to fix repeated issues
‚úÖ **PRU strategy**: Use PRUs intentionally for complex validation tasks
‚ö†Ô∏è **You're accountable**: Human oversight required for quality and security

| **Clear description**   | Problem to solve or work required | "Fix null pointer exception in UserService" |
| **Acceptance criteria** | What a good solution looks like   | "Should include unit tests for edge cases"  |
| **Hints/pointers**      | Files that need to be changed     | "Check `src/services/UserService.ts`"       |

### 2. Customize with Additional Context

**Add custom Copilot instructions** so agent understands:

- How to build
- How to test
- How to validate changes

**Other helpful customizations**:

- Customize development environment (`.github/workflows/copilot-setup-steps.yml`)
- Customize/disable firewall
- Extend with Model Context Protocol (MCP)

### 3. Use as a Tool, Not a Replacement

‚ö†Ô∏è **Always review and test** generated content to ensure:

- Meets requirements
- Free of errors
- Free of security concerns

**Before merging**: Thorough validation required

### 4. Use Secure Coding & Code Review Practices

| Practice                              | Why                                                        |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Avoid hard-coded secrets**          | Agent may generate syntactically correct but insecure code |
| **Prevent injection vulnerabilities** | Continue following secure coding best practices            |
| **Apply rigorous testing**            | Validate functionality and edge cases                      |
| **IP scanning**                       | Check for intellectual property issues                     |
| **Vulnerability checks**              | Security scanning before merge                             |

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Agent can generate syntactically correct code that is NOT secure

## Security Measures for Copilot Coding Agent

### Avoiding Privilege Escalation

| Measure                        | Protection                                           |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Write access required**      | Agent only responds to users with write access       |
| **Workflow approval required** | Actions workflows need approval before running       |
| **Hidden character filtering** | Filters hidden characters to reduce prompt injection |

### Constraining Copilot's Permissions

| Constraint                   | What It Means                                              |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Repository access**        | Only accesses repo where creating PR; cannot access others |
| **Branch restrictions**      | Pushes limited to `copilot/` branches (not default branch) |
| **Secrets/variables**        | No access to org/repo Actions secrets at runtime           |
| **Copilot environment only** | Only secrets/variables in `copilot` environment are passed |

### Preventing Data Exfiltration

**Default protection**: Firewall enabled by default

**Purpose**: Prevent accidental or malicious exfiltration of code or sensitive data

**Customization**: Can customize or disable per organizational policy

üìö **See**: [Customizing or disabling the firewall](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/github-copilot-code-agent/4-customize-extend-validate-copilot-code-agent)

## Limitations of Copilot Coding Agent

‚ö†Ô∏è **Performance varies** depending on codebase and inputs

### Key Limitations

| Limitation                  | Impact                                                           | What to Do                                     |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Limited scope & quality** | LLM may not handle certain structures or obscure languages       | Quality varies by language coverage            |
| **Potential biases**        | Training data may include biases                                 | Agent may lean toward certain languages/styles |
| **Security risks**          | Generated code based on repo context could expose sensitive info | Thorough review required                       |
| **Inaccurate code**         | Code may appear correct but be semantically/syntactically wrong  | Validate fit, patterns, and style              |
| **Public code matches**     | May produce matches/near-matches even if "Block" is set          | References may not be provided                 |
| **Legal/regulatory**        | Compliance requirements vary                                     | Ensure compliance with obligations             |
